# Predicting Heart Disease with Logistic Regression
This project uses a Logistic Regression model to predict the risk of heart disease based on key health indicators like age, cholesterol, and blood pressure. The model achieves an accuracy of 80.49% on test data, demonstrating its ability to generalize to new cases.

Features:
Dataset: Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle
Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
Key Outputs: Confusion matrix and model performance metrics
Future Improvements:
Explore additional features and advanced machine learning models like Random Forests.
Perform further feature engineering and data augmentation.
